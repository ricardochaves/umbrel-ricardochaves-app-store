  Onion Farm allows for quick and easy hosting of websites on the Onion network, also known as the deep web.
  
  Simply upload a zip file containing the website with the index.html file in the root directory and it automatically generates a functional link on the deep web.
  
  This means the site will be available on the hidden internet, protected by additional layers of security and privacy.
  With this project, anyone can have their site online on the deep web in a simple and fast manner, without having to worry about complicated server setup.
